						<p>Objective: given an area enclosed by a wire with passing AC current, find and pick up all the dropped coins.
						</br></br>
						Implementation: Using the inductors and a microcontroller, we are able to detect a changing electric current as well as the change in 
						the inductor's magnetic field. This allows us to locate the perimeter of the enclosed area or the coin. Depending on the magnitude of induced current,
						the microchip recognizes the signal as "coin detected" or "perimeter detected". Using these flags, we either turn around or initiate
						a coin pick up sequence.

						<p>Main objective: build a parallelogram robot that is able to play a simple tune on an octave of a piano
						</br></br>
						Sub-team objective: implement PID controller that will respond to external stresses and drive the piano arms in a specified sequence
						</br></br>
						Personal goal: create a web interface that is able to manipulate speed and tune, as well as, display current note sequence, state and other characteristics
						</br></br>
						Implementation: Arduino Yun's ATmega chip was used as a main hardware interface. Yun's Atheros processor was used a host for a local web server and storage for a database.
						Interconnecting the processors with http communication results in a user being able to remotely control the robot
						as well as be aware of current processes and status

							Objective: build a program on a microchip that would run a regular toaster oven through different states required to reflow solder a PCB
							</br></br>
							Implementation: Using a thermocouple to measure the electrical potential diffence across the wire, and using the microcontroller
							to read and convert it to temperature, we are able to know and control the temperature according to the user specifications, inputted through 
							mechanical user interface. Throughout the process, time, temperature and microcontroller data have been transmitted over a bluetooth signal and 
							plotted to provide visual schematic of the process, which would verify if its suitable and safe to be used for an actual PCB.

							Objective: Assemble a line detecting robot capable of completing a designed track at shortest time possible
						</br></br>
							Implementation: A set of 5 photosensors was used to recognize the main line. Depending on which of the sensors were active,
							a program on PIC32 microchip would determine the appropriate response. By increasing the sensor's sensitivity by amplifying output signal, robot was able
							 to react faster, decreasing the track completion time by 20%.
